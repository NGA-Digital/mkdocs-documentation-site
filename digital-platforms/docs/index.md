# NGA Digital Platforms User Guide

## Digital Platforms

The Digital Team at The National Gallery of Australia (NGA) is responsible for the Gallery's digital products. These are:

The NGA Website
DiVA
Search the Collection (StC)

While these products exist independently, they all have a relationship with each other.

### The NGA Website

The NGA website is the main point of call for our online visitors. It is found at https://nga.gov.au. The content it houses includes visiting information, editorial content, ticket purchasing, online publications and our audio guides.

### DiVA

DiVA is our digital asset management system (DAMS). A DAMS is software used to organise, store, manage, and distribute digital assets. Digital assets include files like images, videos, audio and documents.

DiVA also produces a Collection API. That is used by the NGA Website and Search the Collection.

### Search the Collection (StC)

StC is the online database of all works of art and artists in our collection. It is made up of works of art and artist pages. This is found at https://searchthecollection.nga.gov.au.
